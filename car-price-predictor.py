# ### Inconsistency with the data
# - year has many non-year values
# - year object should be converted to integer
# - price has Ask for Price
# - Price object should be converted to integer
# - kms_driven has kms with integers
# - kms_driven object should have integer value
# - kms_driven has nan values
# - fuel_type has nan values
# - The name are too long so we will only keep the first three words of the name column

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline


# #### Let us convert categorical data into numerical data using one OneHotEncoder

# #### Overall, make_column_transformer() simplifies the process of preprocessing and handling heterogeneous datasets, making it easier to apply machine learning models to real-world data. It is often used in conjunction with other scikit-learn components, such as pipelines and model selection tools, to build end-to-end machine learning workflows.
# 
# #### The main function of the make_column_transformer() function from scikit-learn is to create a data preprocessing pipeline that applies different transformers to specific columns of a dataset.
# 
# #### In machine learning and data analysis tasks, datasets often contain a mix of different types of features, such as numerical, categorical, or text-based features. Before feeding the data into a machine learning model, it's crucial to preprocess and transform the data into a format suitable for the model.
# 
# #### The make_column_transformer() function provides a convenient way to create a transformer that can handle different types of features separately. By specifying different transformers for specific columns, you can apply different preprocessing steps based on the data types. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have a mixture of numerical and categorical features.
# 
# #### make_column_transformer(): This function is part of the preprocessing module in scikit-learn and is used to create a transformer that applies different preprocessing steps to specific columns of a dataset. It allows you to define a series of transformers to be applied to different subsets of the input data.
# 
# #### (OneHotEncoder(), ['name', 'company', 'fuel_type']): This is the first argument passed to make_column_transformer(). It specifies that we want to use the OneHotEncoder() transformer for the columns 'name', 'company', and 'fuel_type'. The OneHotEncoder() is used to encode categorical variables into a one-hot representation.
# 
# #### remainder='passthrough': This is the second argument passed to make_column_transformer(). It indicates what to do with the columns that are not explicitly specified in the first argument. In this case, it is set to 'passthrough', which means any columns not specified will be left unchanged (i.e., they will remain in the dataset as they are).
# 
# #### So, in summary, the column_trans object is a column transformer that applies the OneHotEncoder() to the columns 'name', 'company', and 'fuel_type' while leaving all other columns unchanged in the dataset. This is a common preprocessing step for datasets containing categorical variables, as it converts categorical variables into a numerical format suitable for machine learning algorithms while keeping the rest of the data in its original form.

pipe = make_pipeline(column_trans,lr)


# #### In the code you provided, a machine learning pipeline is created using the make_pipeline() function from scikit-learn. The pipeline consists of two main components: a column transformer (column_trans) and a machine learning model (lr). Let's break it down step by step:
# 
# #### column_trans: As mentioned earlier, column_trans is a column transformer created using the make_column_transformer() function. It is a data preprocessing step that applies different transformers to specific columns of a dataset. This is particularly useful when dealing with datasets containing a mix of numerical and categorical features. The column_trans object is defined to handle the preprocessing of the features before they are fed into the machine learning model.
# 
# #### lr: lr is a machine learning model that will be used for training and making predictions. The variable lr represents a model object, and it could be any scikit-learn classifier or regressor (e.g., LinearRegression, LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, etc.).
# 
# #### make_pipeline(): This function is used to create a pipeline that chains together multiple processing steps. It automatically names each step based on the class names of the provided transformers or estimators. The pipeline ensures that the output of each step is passed as input to the next step.
# 
# #### Combining the components using make_pipeline() results in a machine learning pipeline that first applies the column transformation specified in column_trans to preprocess the data and then trains the model lr using the preprocessed data. The pipeline allows you to apply all the steps seamlessly and consistently, making it easier to perform data preprocessing, model training, and predictions in a single coherent workflow.

# In[61]:


np.argmax(scores)


# #### The function np.argmax(scores) is a NumPy function that returns the index of the maximum value in the scores array. It finds the position of the maximum element in the array, based on its value.
